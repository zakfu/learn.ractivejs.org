{"copy":"<p>That's all well and good, but it's a little on the verbose side. You can imagine if we had lots more properties on the capital city object that we wanted to refer to &ndash; we don't want to keep writing <code>{{country.capital.xyz}}</code> if we don't have to.</p>\n\n<p>We don't have to. Instead, we can use a <em>with section</em> to provide <em>context</em>:</p>\n\n<pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>\n{{#with country}}\n  &lt;p&gt;{{name}} is a {{climate.temperature}} country\n  with {{climate.rainfall}} rainfall and a population\n  of {{population}}.&lt;/p&gt;\n{{/with}}\n</pre>\n\n<aside>\n\t<p>Strictly speaking, you don't need the <code>with</code> - you can just use a <code>#</code> sign by itself:</p>\n\n\t<pre class='prettyprint lang-html'</pre>{{#country}}\n  &lt;p&gt;{{name}} is a {{climate.temperature}} country\n  with {{climate.rainfall}} rainfall and a population\n  of {{population}}.&lt;/p&gt;\n{{/country}}</pre>\n\n\t<p>In this case, when Ractive looks up <code>country</code>, it will decide whether to render a <code>with</code>, <code>if</code> or <code>each</code> section based on its value. We'll learn about <code>if</code> and <code>each</code> shortly.</p>\n\n\t<p>Generally, it's better to be explicit about which type of section you intend &ndash; other programmers (including future you) will be grateful.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Go ahead and update the template, creating a section for the capital as well. (You can either create a <code>{{#with country.capital}}</code> section, or a <code>{{#with capital}}</code> section <em>inside</em> the <code>{{#with country}}</code> section. Use whichever structure is easier in a given situation.)</p>\n\n<aside>\n\t<p>Notice that if you create a <code>{{#with capital}}</code> section, you could end up having two <code>{{name}}</code> variables &ndash; one for the country, one for the capital.<p>\n\n\t<p>We say that the capital <code>{{name}}</code> reference has a two-level <em>context stack</em> &ndash; if the innermost context (<code>country.capital</code>) has a <code>name</code> property, <code>{{name}}</code> resolves to the <code>country.capital.name</code> <em>keypath</em>.</p>\n\n\t<p>If not, Ractive moves <em>up the context stack</em> (in this case, to <code>country</code>, and then to the root <code>data</code> object) until it <em>does</em> find a context with a <code>name</code> property. Once a reference is resolved, its keypath is fixed. Unresolved references are re-evaluated with each call to <code>ractive.set()</code>.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>If you get stuck, hit the <strong>fix code</strong> button.</p>\n\n<p>Execute the code.</p>\n","init":true,"javascript":"var ractive = new Ractive({\n  el: output,\n  template: template,\n  data: {\n    country: {\n      name: 'The UK',\n      climate: { temperature: 'cold', rainfall: 'excessive' },\n      population: 63230000,\n      capital: { name: 'London', lat: 51.5171, lon: -0.1062 }\n    }\n  }\n});\n","template":"<h2>Country profile</h2>\n\n<p>{{country.name}} is a {{country.climate.temperature}} country with {{country.climate.rainfall}} rainfall and a population of {{country.population}}.</p>\n\n<p>The capital city is {{country.capital.name}} (<a href='https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place/{{country.capital.name}}/@{{country.capital.lat}},{{country.capital.lon}},12z' target='_blank'>see map</a>).</p>\n","fixed":{"template":"<h2>Country profile</h2>\n\n{{#with country}}\n  <p>{{name}} is a {{climate.temperature}} country with {{climate.rainfall}} rainfall and a population of {{population}}.</p>\n\n  {{#with capital}}\n    <p>The capital city is {{name}} (<a href='https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place/{{name}}/@{{lat}},{{lon}},12z' target='_blank'>see map</a>).</p>\n  {{/with}}\n\n{{/with}}\n"},"index":1,"numSiblings":3,"tutorialTitle":"Nested properties","tutorialIndex":1}
